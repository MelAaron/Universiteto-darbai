@W: MT529 :"c:\users\pc\documents\1. ktu\1. ktu\2 semestras\2. slp\4lab_2\cntr12.vhd":26:2:26:3|Found inferred clock TOP_CNT|CLK_I which controls 7 sequential elements including CNT_1.CNT_A[3:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
